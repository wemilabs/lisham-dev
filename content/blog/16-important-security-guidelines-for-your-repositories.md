## Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Why

Enabling 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a code from a security app, in addition to their password.

### How

- **Access GitHub Account Settings**:
  - Log into your GitHub account.

  - Navigate to your account settings.

- **Enable 2FA**:
  - Go to "Password and authentication."

  - Scroll down to "Two-factor authentication" and click "Enable two-factor authentication."

  - Choose your preferred method (e.g., Authenticator App, Security Keys).

  - Follow the prompts to set up 2FA.

## Enforce SSH Keys

### Why

Enforcing SSH keys provides a more secure way to authenticate users and reduce the risk of password theft. It enhances the security of your repositories by ensuring that only authorized users can access them.

### How

- **Generate SSH Keys**:
  - Open a terminal or command prompt.

  - Run the following command:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

  - Let's break it down before moving further:
    - `ssh-keygen`: This is the main command to generate a new SSH key pair. SSH keys are used for secure authentication in various applications, such as logging into a server or connecting to GitHub.
    - `-t ed25519`: Specifies the type of key to generate. Here, `Ed25519` refers to a modern public-key algorithm known for being fast, secure, and efficient. It's a good choice for generating SSH keys.
    - `-C "your_email@example.com"`: Adds a comment to the key, which is your email address.
    - **What happens when you run this command?**
      - The system will ask you where to save the generated key. By default, it suggests saving it in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. You can press Enter to accept the default location.
      - **Set a passphrase (optional):** You'll be prompted to enter a passphrase for extra protection. If you set a passphrase, you'll need to enter it every time you use the key. Pressing Enter skips the passphrase step.
      - **Key pair generated:** The command generates two files:
        - **A private key (e.g., `id_ed25519`):** This file should remain secret and stored securely.
        - **A public key (e.g., `id_ed25519.pub`):** This file is shared with the server or service you're connecting to (e.g., GitHub).

- **Add SSH Key to ssh-agent**:
  - **Unix environment**:
    - Evaluate and add the ssh-agent:

    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

    - Copy the public key:

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

  - **MS DOS environment**:
    - Start the ssh-agent in the background:

    ```bash
    start-ssh-agent.cmd
    ```

    - Go the directory where your private key has just been stored:

    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\[username]\.ssh
    ```

    - View the content of the directory and verify our private key has been stored:

    ```bash
    dir
    ```

    - Look for a file with the `.pub` extension in the directory. You should get something alike:

    ```bash
    id_ed25519.pub
    ```

    - Open the public key file with any text editor, in order to copy its content:

    ```bash
    notepad id_ed25519.pub
    ```

- **Add SSH Key to GitHub**:
  - Go to your GitHub account settings.

  - Navigate to "SSH and GPG keys".

  - Click "New SSH key".

  - Paste your public key and give it a title.

  - Click "Add SSH key".

## Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Why

Implementing RBAC helps in managing access to repositories by assigning specific permissions to users based on their roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and changes.

### How

- **Create Teams and Roles**:
  - In your GitHub organization, create teams (e.g., Developers, Reviewers, Security).

  - Assign roles with specific permissions (e.g., write, maintain, admin).

- **Configure Repository Access**:
  - Set access levels for each repository (e.g., protected branches).

  - Use JSON to define protection rules for branches, including required reviews and status checks2.

  - Assign teams to repositories with specific permissions.

  - Configure branch protection rules:
    - Set required approvals for protected branches.

    - Enable required status checks.

    - Configure required reviews for pull requests.

    - Set branch permissions for each team.

## SSH Key Usage

Now that you have generated and added your SSH key to GitHub, here's how you can use it to connect to securely:

### 1. Cloning a repository via SSH

To clone a repository using SSH, you need to use the SSH URL of the repository. Here’s how you can do it:

- **Find the SSH URL**:
  - Go to the repository on GitHub.

  - Click the "Code" button.

  - Select "SSH" from the dropdown menu.

  - Copy the SSH URL (it should look something like git@github.com:username/repository.git).

- **Clone the Repo**:
  - Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.

  - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

  - Run the following command to clone the repository using SSH:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
  ```

### 2. Push Changes using SSH

After cloning, you can push changes to the repository using SSH, following these steps:

- **Make changes**:
  - Edit files in your local repo

- **Stage and commit changes**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

- **Push changes**:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch_name>
```

Replace branch-name with the name of your branch.

### Test your SSH Connection

To ensure your SSH connection is working correctly, you can test it by running:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message indicating that you've successfully authenticated.

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure that:

- Your SSH key is correctly added to your GitHub account.

- The SSH key is added to the SSH agent (ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa or ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519).

- You are using the correct SSH URL for cloning and pushing.

#### Additional Tips

- **Use Git Bash or WSL**: For a more Unix-like experience, consider using Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for Git operations.

- **Keep Your SSH Keys Secure**: Always keep your private SSH key secure and never share it publicly.
